## How to Deploy (The Actual Commands)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd e:\OneDrive\Desktop\google_calender_clone

git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoogleCalendarClone.git

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit: Google Calendar Clone - full stack project"

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username**

That's literally all you need to do! ✅

---

## Security Check

✅ Your `.gitignore` file already protects:
- `node_modules/` - Won't upload (too big)
- `.env` - Won't upload (secrets stay safe)
- Build folders - Won't upload
- IDE settings - Won't upload

**You're secure!** 🔒

---

## What Gets Uploaded

```
✅ UPLOADS:
  - backend/ source code
  - frontend/ source code
  - README.md and docs
  - package.json files
  - .env.example (template only)
  - .gitignore

❌ DOESN'T UPLOAD:
  - node_modules/ (ignored)
  - .env file (ignored)
  - build/ folders
  - .vscode/ settings
  - Anything in .gitignore
```

---

## Expected Time

- **First deployment:** 5-10 minutes
- **Future updates:** 30 seconds
  ```powershell
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin main
  ```

---

## Verification After Push

Visit: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoogleCalendarClone`

Look for:
- ✅ `backend` folder visible
- ✅ `frontend` folder visible
- ✅ `README.md` displayed
- ✅ All your files there
- ✅ NO `node_modules` folder
- ✅ NO `.env` file

If you see all these = Success! 🎉
