## Tone Examples

### Introduction
```
"A full-stack calendar app that works a lot like Google Calendar. 
Built with React on the frontend, Node.js + Express on the backend, 
and MongoDB for data storage."
```
✅ Sounds like a real person talking about their project

### Features Explanation
```
"When you create an event that repeats (like 'every Monday'), 
I only store it once in the database with the recurrence info. 
When the frontend asks for events in a date range, the server 
automatically expands it into individual instances."
```
✅ Explains the design decision in human terms

### Troubleshooting
```
"MongoDB won't connect?
- Make sure MongoDB is running (mongod)
- Check MONGODB_URI in backend/.env
- If using MongoDB Atlas, verify network access"
```
✅ Real, practical advice, not formal specs
